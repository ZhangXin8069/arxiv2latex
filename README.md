## About arXiv2Latex 

- Download the source latex code of multiple arxiv papers with one click. 

## Motivation behind

To facilitate our paper writing, we may usually need to download and copy the latex source code of other's papers. However, this process can become very tedious if there are many papers to download. So I develop this tool to automate this process. I implement it simply with `request` and `tarfile`. To make it an online free service, I push this project online with the help of `Streamlight` and `Heroku app`. Here is the demo app link: https://arxiv2latex.herokuapp.com/.

## To-do

- [ ] Unlimited download paper number (Solution to download large zip files with `Streamlight`)
